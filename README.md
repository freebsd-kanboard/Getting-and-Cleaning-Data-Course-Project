# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo contains solution for the task. File `run_analysis.R` is merging the data sets
and calculates means per activity and subject. The data is being saved as a file, by default
as `tidy_data.txt`.

Please feel free to adapt properly the `pth.*` variables in the `run_analysis.R` script.

The script requires `reshape2` R package, which can be installed using standard R methods.
